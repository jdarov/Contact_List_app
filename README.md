# 📇 Contact List App

This is a beginner-friendly Contact List Manager built with Python and JSON — a perfect first step into creating real-world, data-driven applications. It allows you to add, view, and save contacts with names and relationships, all stored in a persistent `.json` file.

## 🚀 Features

- Add new contacts with first name, last name, and relationship
- Save contacts to a `.json` file for future use
- Load and display contacts from file on program start
- Clean, readable code with helpful comments
- Great practice in file I/O, dictionaries, and list manipulation

## 💡 Why I Built This

As part of my journey from trucking to tech, this app helped reinforce Python fundamentals like:
- Working with JSON files
- Using dictionaries and lists effectively
- Writing clean, reusable functions
- Creating user-friendly terminal applications

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **JSON** for data storage
- Runs directly in the **command-line terminal**

## 🧪 Example Contact Entry

```json
{
  "first_name": "Josh",
  "last_name": "Darovitz",
  "relationship": "Myself"
}
```
