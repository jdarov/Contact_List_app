### CONTACT LIST CLI APP ###

```
Welcome to my Contact List app!

This is my first CLI Python solo project. In this I will be building/updating an app that integrates with the terminal to
prepare a JSON file holding all your contact info. You can then run the program to view your contacts, add a new contact, 
and save it to the list.

Future features:
    Additional spot for emails
    Remove contacts from list 
    Won't save duplicates if name/number/email already in list
